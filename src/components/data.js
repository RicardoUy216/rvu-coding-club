        practice navigating the online
         code editor, Replit, before diving into basic Python programming.
         Conditional statements allow you to make decisions based on the values of
         variables or the result of comparisons. Learn about the different types,
         like booleans and comparison operators, and how they allow you to create programs
         that are vastly more complex.
         Then practice using logical operators to enhance conditional statements.
         Time to add some structure to your data — using lists to manage collections of data,
         index-based retrieval to access and manipulate list items,
          and dictionaries to represent data with multiple properties.
          Need to generate the same block of code repeatedly without having to write
           it multiple times? That’s where loops come in. Learn to differentiate between
            while and for loops,
           and best practices for using loops in your programming.
           Learn what functions are used for in Python programming. Structure a function
           and add parameters. Then take what you learned in previous units and practice
            creating functions that include
           loops and conditional logic to generate specific return values.`

         relationship works. Then take a tour of the
        online code editor you’ll be using for the hands-on portion of the workshop.
        Time to get your hands on the “bones” of the web. Learn the basics of HTML before diving
         into the online code editor to build a simple webpage using common HTML tags, assign
         attributes to tags and elements,
        and apply properly formatted HTML, with correctly indented markup and attribute syntax.
        Now, let’s add some character to your HTML. You’ll learn the basics of CSS and how
        it works, then take your existing HTML code and apply
        basic CSS syntax to adjust color and alignment, and turn links into buttons.
        The final piece of the web development puzzle. Learn how JavaScript adds interactivity
         to a website using data types, control flow, and functions. Then get hands-on practice using DOM (Document Object Model)
         events and event listeners to create interactive webpages.`

experience with JavaScript programming, interacting with the DOM, and event listeners.
In addition, students will discover how AI models can help debug issues faster, as well as
how to leverage AI chatbots through prompt engineering to clarify misconceptions.
Students learn ReactJS, a component-based JavaScript framework, and have the
opportunity to pick up key industry skills by building a project that interacts with an API.
Students will also gain understanding of how AI tools can assist with code completion as
well as generate unit tests for components.
Students gain a thorough understanding of back end development basics, while learning
a new language, Python. Next, students will get comfortable with object-oriented
programming and storing information in databases using A1 SQL Builder and object
relational mapping. Once students understand Python basics, they will learn to integrate
AI features into their apps.
Students learn Flask, a Python web framework, before using it to create their own JSON
API along with scalable front ends with React, creating slick, functional, and interactive
applications.
After completing the four phases, each with their own group project, students work with
instructors to come up with solo project concepts and spend dedicated time building a
truly sophisticated application on their own. Students receive plenty of instructor
feedback along the way, while diving deep into various advanced technologies needed to
bring their concepts to life. Students have the opportunity to share or present their final
