         relationship works. Then take a tour of the
        online code editor you’ll be using for the hands-on portion of the workshop.
        Time to get your hands on the “bones” of the web. Learn the basics of HTML before diving
         into the online code editor to build a simple webpage using common HTML tags, assign
         attributes to tags and elements,
        and apply properly formatted HTML, with correctly indented markup and attribute syntax.
        Now, let’s add some character to your HTML. You’ll learn the basics of CSS and how
        it works, then take your existing HTML code and apply
        basic CSS syntax to adjust color and alignment, and turn links into buttons.
        The final piece of the web development puzzle. 
        Learning Outcomes:
Learn how JavaScript works and how it is used in web development.
Make web pages interactive by typing and running JavaScript code.
Use variables to store and change data.
Use data types and operators to do logic and calculations.
Organize and reuse code by functions.
Conditions, like "if" and "else," let you control how a program runs. Learn how to use them.
Use loops (like for and while) to do things over and over again.
Learn how to use Document Object Model (DOM) to change HTML elements.
Make interactive user experiences by handling events like button clicks and form submissions.
Debugging JavaScript code.`

experience with JavaScript programming, interacting with the DOM, and event listeners.
In addition, students will discover how AI models can help debug issues faster, as well as
how to leverage AI chatbots through prompt engineering to clarify misconceptions.
Students learn ReactJS, a component-based JavaScript framework, and have the
opportunity to pick up key industry skills by building a project that interacts with an API.
Students will also gain understanding of how AI tools can assist with code completion as
well as generate unit tests for components.
Students gain a thorough understanding of back end development basics, while learning
a new language, Python. Next, students will get comfortable with object-oriented
programming and storing information in databases using A1 SQL Builder and object
relational mapping. Once students understand Python basics, they will learn to integrate
AI features into their apps.
