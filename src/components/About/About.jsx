    <h2>Empowering tomorrow’s workforce through education</h2>

    RVU Computer School want to create equal access to the data-driven 
    jobs of the future and 
unlock diverse human potential at scale.

Data and digital literacy are the most important skills for 
the future of work. Yet, pervasive structural barriers 
hinder equitable access to vital training. This leads 
to widening skills gaps within organizations and feelings 
of stagnation among workers.

In response, we're democratizing access to key skills 
through employer-sponsored training, ensuring that every 
individual can thrive in the digital age. </p>
<h1 className='mission
